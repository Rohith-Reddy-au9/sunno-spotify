# Suno-Spotify

Spotify is one of the most used/popular Music Player around the world

Before entering the development mode,
I divided this Spotify into minor components/steps

* Step1:
    * Created a simple Layout 
		* Topbar
		* Sidebar
		* Content
		* Playbar
    ---
* Step2:
	* Designing the Sidebar layout 
    ---
* Step 3:
	* Crated a Modal Box for playlist
	A toast should appear once that finishes, letting us know that the playlist has been created.
    ---
* Step:4
	* Display Playlist Name In Content Component
	Created Reducer 
    ---
* Step5
	* We can start displaying our songs from the JSON file. For displaying the songs, we create a table and produce a row for each song we have. 
    ---
* Step6:
	* Implemented Favorite icon and Playlist
	Adding songs to our Playlist Through Plus Icon.
	Created drop-down along with the icon. If we don't have any custom playlists drop-down will not be appearing.
